# Customer-Churn-Prediction-ML
A Machine Learning model to predict customer churn using the Ultimate Customer Churn Prediction Challenge dataset..

# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will stop using a service (churn) based on their usage patterns and demographics. This was built as part of the **Ultimate Customer Churn Prediction Challenge**.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM

### 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing churn patterns.
3. **Model Training:** Training multiple ML models to find the best accuracy.
4. **Evaluation:** Comparing models using Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
